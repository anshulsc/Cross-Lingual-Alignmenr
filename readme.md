# **Training Our Own FastText Embedding and Preprocessing Pipeline**

## **Overview**

This documentation outlines the steps to build your own text embedding model from scratch using Wikipedia data. The process involves downloading Wikipedia dumps, extracting relevant articles, preprocessing the text, and training a FastText embedding model. The pipeline consists of the following scripts:

1. **`wiki_download.py`**: Automates downloading the Wikipedia dump.
2. **`extract_articles.py`**: Extracts articles from the Wikipedia dump using WikiExtractor.
3. **`preprocess_text.py`**: Cleans and preprocesses the extracted text.
4. **`train_embedding.py`**: Trains a FastText embedding model based on the preprocessed text.

## **Prerequisites**

Before starting, ensure that the following are installed and configured:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Conda** for environment management
- **WikiExtractor** for extracting articles from Wikipedia dumps
- **Required Python packages**: `numpy`, `pandas`, `gensim`, `sklearn`, and others specified in `requirements.txt`.

---

## **1. Download Wikipedia Dump**

Wikipedia dumps are large files containing all the articles in a given language. You can download a specific language dump or the entire dump.

1. **Download the Wikipedia dump**: The `wiki_download.py` script automates the process of fetching the latest Wikipedia dump. It downloads the compressed `.xml.bz2` file from Wikipedia.

Run the following command:

```bash
python wiki_download.py
```

By default, the downloaded dumps will be stored in the `data/raw/` directory:

```
data/raw/hiwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2  # Hindi Wikipedia dump
data/raw/enwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2  # English Wikipedia dump
```

---

## **2. Extract Articles from the Wikipedia Dump**

Once the dump is downloaded, we need to extract plain text from the XML format. This is achieved using the WikiExtractor tool.

1. **Install WikiExtractor**:

```bash
pip install wikiextractor
```

2. **Run WikiExtractor**: Use WikiExtractor to extract articles in JSON format while removing unnecessary templates.

For Hindi:

```bash
wikiextractor -o data/extracted/extracted_hi --json --no-templates data/raw/hiwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2
```

For English:

```bash
wikiextractor -o data/extracted/extracted_en --json --no-templates data/raw/enwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2
```

3. **Extract articles using the script**: Alternatively, you can use the `extract_articles.py` script to automate this process:

```bash
python extract_articles.py
```

The extracted articles will be stored in the `data/processed/` directory in `.txt` format. You can configure the input and output paths in the `config.yaml` file.

Output Example:

```
data/processed/final_en.txt
```

---

## **3. Preprocess the Extracted Text**

The extracted articles may contain noise and formatting issues, which need to be cleaned up before training the embedding model.

1. **Text Cleaning**: The `preprocess_text.py` script performs several preprocessing steps:
   - Removing HTML tags, punctuation, and other unwanted characters.
   - Converting text to lowercase.
   - Removing stopwords (optional).

2. **Tokenization**: It splits the text into words and prepares it for training by standardizing the format.

Run the following command to preprocess the data:

```bash
python preprocess_text.py
```

Preprocessed text will be saved in the `data/processed/` directory:

```
data/processed/preprocessed_en.txt
```

This cleaned and tokenized text will be used as input for embedding training.

---

## **4. Train FastText Embedding Model**

Once the text is preprocessed, it's ready for training a FastText embedding model. The FastText model is particularly good for capturing subword information, making it suitable for languages with rich morphology.

1. **Training**: Run the `train_embedding.py` script to train a FastText model. You can configure the model parameters (e.g., vector size, context window) via the `config.yaml` file.

Run the following command:

```bash
python train_embedding.py
```

The trained model will be saved in the `embedding/trained/` directory in `.bin` format:

```
embedding/trained/fasttext_model.bin
```

This model can be used for various downstream NLP tasks such as text classification, similarity searches, or information retrieval.

---

## **Configuration**

All paths, parameters, and settings for downloading, extracting, preprocessing, and training are stored in the `config.yaml` file. This file centralizes the configuration and makes it easy to adjust the pipeline without modifying the code.

## **Directory Structure**

Here's the recommended directory structure for the project:

```
/project-root
│
├── /data/                    # Store raw, extracted, and processed data
│   ├── /raw/                 # Raw Wikipedia dumps
│   ├── /extracted/           # Extracted Wikipedia articles
│   └── /processed/           # Preprocessed text data
│
├── /embedding/               # Store trained embeddings
│   └── /trained/             # Trained embedding models
│
├── /scripts/                 # Python scripts for each step
│   ├── wiki_download.py
│   ├── extract_articles.py
│   ├── preprocess_text.py
│   └── train_embedding.py
│
├── config.yaml               # Configuration file for paths, parameters
├── README.md                 # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
```

---

## **Dependencies**

Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **Next Steps**

1. **Experimentation**: Try different preprocessing techniques, such as stemming or lemmatization, to further clean the text.
2. **Embedding Models**: Experiment with different models, such as GloVe or Word2Vec, to compare results.
3. **Applications**: Use the trained embeddings for downstream tasks such as clustering, classification, or semantic similarity.
