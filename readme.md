Here's the detailed documentation for your text embedding and preprocessing pipeline. The steps cover downloading the Wikipedia dump, using WikiExtractor, and following through with extraction, preprocessing, and training:

# **Text Embedding and Preprocessing Pipeline**

## **Overview**

This documentation outlines the steps to download Wikipedia data, extract articles, preprocess the text, and finally train a text embedding model. The following scripts are part of the pipeline:

1. `wiki_download.py`: Automates downloading the Wikipedia dump.
2. `extract_articles.py`: Extracts articles from the Wikipedia dump using WikiExtractor.
3. `preprocess_text.py`: Cleans and preprocesses the extracted text for further analysis.
4. `train_embedding.py`: Trains an embedding model based on the preprocessed text data.

### **Prerequisites**

- **Python 3.x**
- **Conda** for environment management
- **WikiExtractor** for article extraction
- **Required Python packages**: numpy, pandas, gensim, sklearn (and any others defined in your environment).

### **1. Download Wikipedia Dump**

1. The Wikipedia dump file can be quite large. To download it, run the script `wiki_download.py`, which automates the process of fetching the dump. This script may download a specific language dump or a general dump based on your configuration file (`config.yaml`).

```bash
python wiki_download.py
```

2. The download will store the Wikipedia data in a compressed format (usually `.xml.bz2`).

### **2. Extract Articles from Wikipedia Dump**

After downloading the Wikipedia dump, the next step is to extract the text content using WikiExtractor.

1. **Install WikiExtractor**:
   You can install it by running:

```bash
pip install wikiextractor
```

```bash
wikiextractor -o data/extracted/extracted_hi --json --no-templates  data/raw/hiwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2
```

2. **Extract articles**:
   Run `extract_articles.py` to parse the downloaded dump and extract relevant articles. This script uses the WikiExtractor tool internally to extract plain text from the Wikipedia XML dump.

```bash
python extract_articles.py
```

The script will output extracted articles into a specified directory, usually in `.txt` format. The configuration for input/output directories can be set in the `config.yaml` file.

### **3. Preprocess the Extracted Text**

The extracted text is often noisy and needs to be cleaned and tokenized before being used for embedding. The `preprocess_text.py` script handles this preprocessing:

1. **Text Cleaning**: Remove non-relevant characters, such as punctuation, HTML tags, or any specific formatting from Wikipedia articles.
2. **Tokenization**: The script tokenizes the text into words and prepares it for training by standardizing the text format (lowercasing, removing stopwords, etc.).

To preprocess the data:

```bash
python preprocess_text.py
```

The preprocessed text will be stored for the next step: embedding training.

### **4. Train Embedding Model**

Once the text is preprocessed, you can train a word embedding model on it using the `train_embedding.py` script. This script allows you to train various embedding models such as Word2Vec, FastText, or others depending on the configuration.

1. **Training**: Use `train_embedding.py` to train the embedding model. It supports configurable options for model type, vector size, context window, and more via the `config.yaml` file.

```bash
python train_embedding.py
```

2. The trained model will be saved to disk and can be used for downstream tasks such as text classification, similarity searches, or other NLP tasks.

### **Configuration**

The `config.yaml` file is the central place for configuring paths, parameters for extraction, preprocessing, and model training. Be sure to update it with your desired settings for the input dump, output paths, preprocessing steps, and model parameters.

### **Directory Structure**

Here’s a suggested directory structure for the project:

```
/project-root
│
├── /data/                  # Store raw and processed data
├── /scripts/                # All the Python scripts
│   ├── wiki_download.py
│   ├── extract_articles.py
│   ├── preprocess_text.py
│   └── train_embedding.py
├── config.yaml              # Configuration file for all steps
├── README.md                # Documentation
└── requirements.txt         # Python dependencies
```

### **Dependencies**

Ensure that you install all necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Next Steps**

- Experiment with different text preprocessing techniques to improve the quality of the embeddings.
- Try different embedding models like FastText or GloVe, depending on the task.
- Use the trained embeddings for downstream applications, such as classification, clustering, or information retrieval.
